# Book recommendation system.

***Final project for the Building AI course.***

## Summary

This system will help Goodreads users have a better recommendation system based on collaborative or content-based filtering, or a combination of both.</br>
This project analyzes user interests and suggests books that might interest them. The goal is to help many people around the world who love reading discover new books in an easy and personalized way.</br>


## Concept
My idea solves problems when recommending other books or reading material to Goodreads users.</br>
This problem is common on the app today, in 2025, because sometimes users can't find reading material similar to their current or previous reading material.</br>
My personal motivation is to try to help users get better service in recommending future reading material.</br>
This topic is important and interesting because it helps many people know what their next book to read will be.</br>

Various Problems:</br>
- Lack of an efficient recommendation service.</br>
- Users find it difficult to find recommended reading similar to what they are reading or have already read.</br>
- Does not improve aesthetics.</br>
- Recommendations can sometimes be ignored by the user if they don't like what is shown, by selecting the "Not interested" option.</br>

### What recommendation features does Goodreads currently have?</br>
On Goodreads, we can currently ask the platform to suggest books based on our favorite genres from the books already on our shelves.
You can also use the book lists created by other users. You can find lists on any topic, which are also a good starting point for discovering new books in your favorite genres. </br>
In the browser menu, you have two options and a few others, such as the Explorer, which allows you to discover books and authors and then add them to your library. </br>
The biggest drawback is that it's a platform aimed at English-speaking audiences, especially as a native speaker, rather than Spanish speakers, for example. </br>
To search for recommended books in your native language, you must follow a series of steps indicated on the page. </br>
To check these recommendations, use [my Goodreads account.](https://www.goodreads.com/emece_reading)

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
